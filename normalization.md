# Normalizing The Database Design

## Objective
Apply normalization principles to ensure the database is in the third normal form (3NF).

### Instructions:

* Review the schema and identify any potential redundancies or violations of normalization principles.
* Adjust the database design to achieve 3NF, if necessary.
* Provide an explanation of the normalization steps in this Markdown file.

### Results
