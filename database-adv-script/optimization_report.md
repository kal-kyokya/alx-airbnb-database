# Optimize Complex Queries

## Objective

Refactor complex queries to improve performance.

## Instructions

* Write an initial query that retrieves all bookings along with the user details, property details, and payment details and save it in ```<a href="https://github.com/kal-kyokya/alx-airbnb-database/blob/main/database-adv-script/perfomance.sql" target="_blank">perfomance.sql</a>```.
* Analyze the queryâ€™s performance using ```EXPLAIN``` and identify any inefficiencies.
* Refactor the query to reduce execution time, such as reducing unnecessary joins or using indexing.
