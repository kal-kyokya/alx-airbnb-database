# Implement Indexes for Optimization

## Objective

Identify and create indexes to improve query performance.

## Instructions

* Identify high-usage columns in ```User```, ```Booking```, and ```Property``` tables (e.g., columns used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY clauses).
* Write SQL ```CREATE INDEX``` commands to create appropriate indexes for those columns and save them in database_index.sql.
* Measure the query performance before and after adding indexes using ```EXPLAIN``` or ```ANALYZE```.
