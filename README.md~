# DataScape: Mastering Database Design

## About the Project
This project is part of the comprehensive <b>ALX Airbnb Database Module</b>, focusing on database design, normalization, schema creation, and seeding. By working through these tasks, learners will design and build a robust relational database for an Airbnb-like application, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and real-world functionality. The project simulates a production-level database system, emphasizing high standards of design, development, and data handling.

## Learning Objectives
As a professional developer, completing these tasks will empower you to:
* Apply advanced principles of database design to model complex systems.
* Master the art of normalization to optimize database efficiency and minimize redundancy.
* Use SQL DDL to define database schema with appropriate constraints, keys, and indexing for performance optimization.
* Write and execute SQL DML scripts to seed databases with realistic sample data, simulating real-world scenarios.
* Enhance collaboration skills by managing repositories, documenting processes, and adhering to professional submission standards.

## Requirements
To successfully complete these tasks, you must:

* Have a strong foundation in relational databases and SQL.
*Be proficient in using Draw.io or similar tools for visual modeling.
* Possess a good understanding of data normalization principles, particularly up to 3NF.
* Have experience with GitHub repositories for documentation and project submission.
* Follow industry best practices for database design and scripting.

## Key Highlights
* <b>Task 1</b>: Craft a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database design, ensuring clear relationships and properly defined entities.
* <b>Task 2</b>: Apply normalization principles to refine your database design, optimizing data integrity and minimizing redundancy.
* <b>Task 3</b>: Create SQL scripts to define the database schema, incorporating primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for optimal query performance.
* <b>Task 4</b>: Populate the database with real-world sample data, simulating an Airbnb-like environment with users, properties, bookings, and payments.
